## What is the <mark style="color:yellow;">Maker Protocol</mark>?

The Maker Protocol is a set of modular [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/) that exist on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts define a system of interactions that result in the DAI stablecoin, Maker Vaults, the MKR token and MakerDAO. 

Actions in the Maker Protocol are performed by users interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

## What is <mark style="color:yellow;">DAI</mark>?

DAI is a stable, fully collateralized, and decentralized currency pegged to the value of the U.S Dollar. DAI can be transacted using the Ethereum blockchain by anyone at any time.

## What are <mark style="color:yellow;">Maker Vaults</mark>?

Maker Vaults are a mechanism in which users can create DAI by locking up other cryptotokens as collateral. Anyone can create a Maker Vault using the Ethereum blockchain at any time.

## What is <mark style="color:yellow;">MKR</mark>?

MKR is the governance token of the Maker Protocol. Owners of MKR vote on risk and management decisions and the outcomes can result in changes to the Maker Protocol.

## What is <mark style="color:yellow;">MakerDAO</mark>?

MakerDAO is the [DAO](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/) that governs and works on the Maker Protocol. Many within MakerDAO hold the MKR token, but this is not a requirement, nor is there a well-defined set of members.
