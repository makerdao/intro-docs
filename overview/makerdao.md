# MakerDAO

MakerDAO is a decentralized entity dedicated to bringing stability to the cryptocurrency economy. Established in 2014, MakerDAO operates as an open-source project on the Ethereum blockchain, functioning as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The platform utilizes the Maker protocol to generate Dai, a stablecoin backed by collateral assets approved through its governance.

## Decentralized Governance Simplified

The heart of MakerDAO's governance revolves around the MKR token, offering holders the power to vote on system changes. This method ensures transparency, swift responsiveness during emergencies, community-led growth, and MakerDAO's continuous evolution. By doing so, users collaboratively guide the protocol's course, nurturing the ecosystem's stability and integrity.

## Voting Process

On-Chain voting takes place in [Maker's Governance Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/), a platform that constitutes a core component of MakerDAO's decentralized governance system. MKR holders can use their voting rights to ratify crucial protocol changes.

## Key Building Blocks

- MKR token & Governance Voting
- Dai stablecoin
- Maker Collateral Vaults
- Oracles

The [MKR token](https://github.com/makerdao/intro-docs/overview/mkr.md) plays a critical role in managing the system, facilitating activities such as voting and ensuring stability, transparency, and efficiency within the protocol. Voting influence aligns with the number of MKR tokens held.

[Dai](https://github.com/makerdao/intro-docs/overview/dai.md) acts as a stablecoin, soft pegged to the US Dollar, functioning as a blockchain alternative to the US dollar that works as a store of value, exchange medium, remittance solutions, and more.

[Maker Vaults](https://github.com/makerdao/intro-docs/overview/vaults.md) represent smart contracts within the Maker protocol, enabling the holding and collateralization of assets. 

[Oracles](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/oracle-module) play a critical role in the Maker Protocol by furnishing dependable price data, vital for maintaining Dai's stability and accuracy. These oracles fetch real-time external data, guiding smart contract decisions and preserving the US Dollar peg.
