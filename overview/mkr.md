# MKR Token

MKR is an ERC-20 token native to the Ethereum Blockchain and serves as the governance token within the MakerDAO protocol, granting holders voting rights to actively shape decisions and uphold system stability. 

The MKR token empowers MakerDAO's decentralization, giving token holders the authority to make decisions and contribute to an inclusive governance system. Participating in governance decisions and ensuring protocol stability are central to the responsibilities of MKR token holders in maintaining MakerDAO's effectiveness and integrity.

The MKR token plays a vital role in shaping the future of the decentralized ecosystem.

Holders of MKR tokens possess the capacity to impact critical decisions and guide the trajectory of the MakerDAO ecosystem. Through MKR tokens, participants actively engage in the governance process, casting votes on essential protocol upgrades, risk parameters, and other significant matters that impact the system's growth and functionality."

## Risk Management and Debt Auctions

In times of unexpected events or system risks, the MKR token plays a critical role. In the event of undercollateralized Vaults resulting in losses, MKR is minted and sold through debt auctions to cover the deficits, ensuring the integrity and sustainability of the Maker Protocol.

## Empowering Decisions

MKR token holders can vote on issues such as collateral types, stability fee adjustments, debt ceilings, and other parameters that ensure the stability, security, and growth of the Maker Protocol. This governance framework allows token holders to collectively shape the future trajectory of the ecosystem.

## Value Accrual

Beyond its governance capabilities, MKR also serves as a mechanism for value accrual. As the MakerDAO ecosystem continues to grow and prosper, the demand for MKR increases. This demand is driven by the intrinsic value of participating in the governance process and the potential benefits derived from holding MKR tokens.
